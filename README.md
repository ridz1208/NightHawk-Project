# NightHawk README
The repository for this project is separated into a Data portion and a codebase portion, only the codebase is available on github due to the lack of support of large files in github.

DATA: 
-----
The nighthawk folder is the actual Project folder in unity  
See shared google drive folder under /NightHawkCode/Nighthawk   
CODE: 
-----
The github is initialized under the Scripts folder.   
$googledrivefolder/NightHawkCode/Nighthawk/Assets/Scripts
  
  
  
    
    
### Suggested procedure:
  1. Make a local copy of the  $googledrivefolder/NightHawkCode/Nighthawk folder.
  2. Open unity and select the open new project option on the first screen.
  3. Navigate to the local copy of the project and open the project.
  4. Work on local copy of project.
  5. selectively include changes to the main project on google drive.
  
### Recommended behavior:
  - Any new feature should be made on the local copy only.
  - Always keep local copy of project up to date with main project folder.
  - Any change should be documented before it is sent to the main project folder.
  - New features should be properly tested before they are added on the Drive.
  - Scripts should NEVER be copied into the main project folder.  
      -> The main project folder uses the same repository as the local copies.  
      -> Changes to any subdirectory of Scripts will be handled EXCLUSIVELY from github.
